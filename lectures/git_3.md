# Git Fundamentals 2024S

## Instructors

+ Massimiliano Carloni
+ Peter Provaznik

## Hands-on instructions

+ [Hands-on 1](../exercise/git/hands-on_1.md)
+ [Hands-on 2](../exercise/git/hands-on_2.md)

## Next steps

+ Take a look at the [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and go through the [Git Tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) as well as some of the other resources referenced below.

+ See if you can find the GitHub repository of open-source software that you use regularly (or have used in the past). Take a look at branches, commits (and commit messages), issues, and pull requests. Also try cloning the repo and play around with the various Git commands locally.

+ Start using Git for your work, if you aren't already. By using it regularly, and doing your best to understand and solve any problems you might encounter, you will get comfortable (and competent) very soon, promise!

## Some tips to remember

+ A commit always represents a complete snapshot of all version-controlled files (at the time). If you have committed something, you can most likely get it back somehow.

+ Make your commits as lean and clean as possible, and have them represent "meaningful chunks of work". Be sure to use descriptive commit messages. Commit often (__at least__ once per day).

+ When collaborating with others, it is good practice to fetch / pull before every commit, to avoid unnecessary merges.
