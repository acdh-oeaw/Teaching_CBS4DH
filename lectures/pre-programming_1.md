(with some review of regular expressions)

### Regular expression recap

   * Character classes: capitalised words, words starting with 'a', numbers, numbers with commas, years

   * bash inside bash
   * pretty much any program that felt like having a shell (SQL, etc.)

   * Line endings
   * Drive and file paths
   * CSV - what it is
   * CSV - platform-specific

### Locale

### Data structures

   * variables
